Born in 1998, I grew up in the midst of the digital rise. As a teenager I started building my first website and experimenting modding on video games I used to play.

While I was in school, I learned development on my own and as a result I very quickly became involved in projects, personal, community and professional.

After that, I started to study computer science as a bachelor's degree at the University of Applied Science Western Switzerland. There, I had the opportunity to reinforce my self-taught knowledge and take an interest in other technologies.

As I was studying, I had the opportunity to work at Zakodium, a company dedicated to the development of tools for storing, processing, visualizing and exploiting scientific data and I also contributed to various open source projects.
